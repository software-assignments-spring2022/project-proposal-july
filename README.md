## What is Videosyncracy?
Videosyncracy is an innovative video-editing program that allows many video creators to simultaneously work on a project at once. Although the idea of collaborating on documents, presentations, and more have become commonplace thanks to Google Docs and other similarities, such has not been the case for more complex creative works, such as videos. As a result, Videosyncracy is a way for multiple content creators to work on videos together at the same time, achieving levels of efficiency never seen before.

## Who is Videosyncracy for?
Videosyncracy can be used by anyone, particularly YouTubers, video and even movie editors. Video-editing is a long and grueling process that may take days or weeks to complete. However, this lengthy labor can easily be reduced if many people were to edit together, similar to Google Docs.

## How will Videosyncracy work?
Video editors can log on to this program using their account. They can select the project they wish to work on, which is stored in a cloud-based system, not just on their local computer. If they want collaborators working on the project as well, they can send Invitation links to their respective accounts. From a collaborator perspective, they can press the link and immediately start working on the video project simultaneously. Videosyncracy also allows creators to upload any videos or ingredients (such as sound effect files, music files, etc) to a cloud drive so that others can use it in the project as well. More functionalities will be rolled out in future updates.

## Scope
Videosyncracy can be created on a website as Internet connection would allow creators to access files in the cloud, just like Google products. The video-editing interface can be an eclectic creation, getting inspiration from other well-known video-editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. The main challenge of implementing Videosyncracy is that since editing videos is more complex than editing documents, we have to ensure that simultaneous video-editing doesn't result in any bugs or glitches.
